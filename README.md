# ES-MADM III – Computational Model

This repository provides the official computational implementation of the
**ES-MADM III (Entropy Synergy Multi-Attribute Decision-Making)** framework.

The model is designed to support robust, interpretable, and numerically
well-posed multi-criteria decision analysis through entropy-based weighting,
integrated criteria importance, and stability-aware ranking mechanisms.

## Scope of the Repository

This repository contains **only the computational core** of the ES-MADM III model.
It is intentionally limited to numerical computations and result generation.

Visualization scripts, diagnostic plots, and presentation-level figures used in
related publications are **excluded by design**, in order to preserve clarity,
reproducibility, and methodological transparency.
